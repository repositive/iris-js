**Notes**

The repository has git hooks on `precommit` and `prepush`. You need to pass the linting criteria before commit and the test and coverage criteria before push. The test requirements are 80% overall.

The only file that is not evaluated during testing is the `index.ts`. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE unless is completely necessary.
